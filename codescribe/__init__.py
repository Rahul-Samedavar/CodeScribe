CodeScribe is a comprehensive Python package for AI-assisted project documentation.  It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate and update docstrings, README files, and other project documentation.  The package includes modules for scanning projects (from local paths or URLs), parsing code to build dependency graphs, interacting with various LLMs (e.g., Groq, Gemini), managing API keys and rate limits, generating documentation in different formats (JSON, text), and updating source files with generated documentation.  CodeScribe orchestrates these modules to provide a streamlined workflow for creating and maintaining high-quality project documentation, boosting developer productivity and improving project understanding.
