# Directory: static

This directory contains static assets used by the Roo Code Hackathon project.  Currently, it does not contain any Python source files and has no subdirectories with accompanying READMEs.  The contents of this directory are expected to be served directly by a web server.  Further details on the specific assets will be provided as they are added.
